Image classification of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves training a deep learning model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The CNN architecture typically includes multiple layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers automatically extract and learn relevant features (like edges, textures, and shapes) from input images.
The process involves:
Data Preparation: Collecting and preprocessing labeled images of cats and dogs (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
Model Building: Designing a CNN with layers suited to detect visual features.
Training: Feeding the model training data and adjusting weights using backpropagation and an optimizer like Adam.
Evaluation: Testing the model on unseen data to assess accuracy.
Prediction: Using the trained model to classify new images as either cat or dog.
CNNs are particularly effective for this task due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies in images.
